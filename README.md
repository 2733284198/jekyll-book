# jekyll-book
A Jekyll and Bootstrap framework for publishing a book online in multiple formats.

This project was forked from [travist/jekyll-kickstart](https://github.com/travist/jekyll-kickstart), a nice framework for starting a clean Jekyll 
site with minimal Bootstrap CSS. Jekyll-Book extends it with a set of plugins, include files and conventions to support a book-like publication. A given set of 
Markdown files are rendered into a series of interlinked pages, and also in a single PDF (and other output files) for downloading. 

An example project: [Github repo](https://github.com/pbinkley/jekyll-book-marriage); [public site](https://www.wallandbinkley.com/rcb/works/marriage/)

The full citation should also be added to ```_includes/citation.html```.

### Content

Content files belong in the ```sections``` directory. They will be rendered according to the alphabetical order of file names, so they should be named appropriately.

Each file should have a YAML metadata header:

```
---
layout: section               # invokes _layouts/section.html
title: "Chapter 2: Tables"    # used in HTML head, jumbotron div, etc.
permalink: 02-chapter2.html   # name of rendered file
id: s02                       # used as id of article element, for chapter-
                              #    specific CSS
group: sections               # grouping in dropdown menus
---
```
