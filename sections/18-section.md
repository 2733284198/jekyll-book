## Appendix K: ACCESSIONS AND WITHDRAWALS

The cooperating libraries agree to forward catalogue cards to the union
catalogue for all accessions made subsequent to the completion of the micro-copying of their catalogues. These cards for new accessions should be sent at
regular intervals agreed upon with the individual library.

The cards sent to the union catalogue are in the form used for the catalogue of the cooperating library with the exception that call numbers, tracing
and special notes, only significant to the library, are omitted.

The handling of accessions is a simple process. The union catalogue
staff keep a record (Appendix K-2) for each library in an accessions file.
The cards arrive in a pack with an attached slip bearing the name of the library, the inclusive dates within which the accessions were made, and the total
of the accessions. From this slip the information is entered on the library's
card in the Union Catalogue's accession record file. The catalogue cards are
stamped with the library's location symbol and filed in the Union Catalogue as
soon as possible.

Cards or slips representing withdrawal of catalogue cards from the library's catalogue subsequent to photographing, are sent with the cards for new
accessions. To facilitate handling, each withdrawal record should be supplied
on a separate slip, or the withdrawn catalogue cards themselves sent.

Prior to the completion of the Union Cataloguing Project, each withdrawn card or slip is stamped with the symbol of the library from which it
was obtained, and placed with the withdrawals from the other cooperating
libraries. Eventually this group of cards and slips is alphabetized and
checked against the corresponding cards in the union catalogue. With a red
pencil merely cross off the symbol of the library found on the union catalogue
card which remains in the catalogue.

Accession record card for each cooperating library kept at the
Union Catalog headquarters. Information for this record is taken
from the slip attached to the cards for accessions since photographing
sent by the cooperating library.
