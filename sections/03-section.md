## CHAPTER I. ORGANIZATION OF UNION CATALOG PROJECT

The personnel required for the compilation of a union catalog will
vary with the size of the catalog and the time within which the work is
to be accomplished.

The project supervisor will be responsible for the technical operation of the project, for establishing relations with the libraries involved,
and for overseeing the work as a whole. The supervisor should have a
capacity for organization, library training, and if possible, some knowledge of union cataloging based upon experience.

The work of the project will be divided among four functional
units as follows:

1. *Photographic unit* This will consist of one or more groups
of three persons per photographing machine. These persons will be
trained, by a librarian, in the technique of selecting the cards to
be photographed, and will operate in the libraries to be covered in the
union catalog, selecting and photographing cards which are to be included.

2. *Typing unit* By this unit, which is the basic production unit
of the project, cards will be typed from the microfilm records prepared
by the photographic unit. There should be a professional librarian as
supervisor of each group of twenty (20) typists. While these librarians
are not required to have a great deal of experience, technical training
as given in a library school is valuable. The librarians chosen to fill
these positions should be able to get along with people, be adaptable,
willing, and possess a great deal of patience.

3. *Filing unit* One trained supervisor will be necessary for the
operation of this unit, to arrange the cards, which have been prepared
by the typing unit, in proper order for the finished catalog.

4. *Revision unit* It is the function of this unit to review and
edit the completed cards. Because of the high degree of skill required,
one librarian will be required to direct two revisers. This unit of the
work is in the experimental stage and the possibilities of using non-professional personnel for this highly specialized work will be discussed
later (Chap. V, p. 33-37).
