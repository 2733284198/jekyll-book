## CHAPTER IV. COMBINING OF DUPLICATE CARDS

Upon the completion of the typing and the filing, duplicate cards
should be withdrawn from the Union Catalog trays and the location symbols
consolidated on a single card. This combining process reduces the number
of individual cards in the catalog; it makes it possible to use the best
cards and to eliminate incomplete or inaccurate cards; and it serves as a
final check on the filing of the Catalog.

"Combining" con be done by the regular filing clerks. As it is left
until the completion of all the filing, those clerks will be familiar with
the filing methods of the project as well as with the standards used in the
making of the cards themselves. Their eyes are trained to observe all essential points of the catalog card, and after a short routine instruction
they may proceed almost independently.

When the combiners first start, they should complete approximately
three trays under the immediate direction of the supervisor. After the
third tray they are permitted to work alone, but they are instructed to
consult the supervisor invariably when in doubt. Cards which raise any
question must not be combined except at the discretion of the supervisor.

One or more of the most expert stampers should receive the same
training, in order that they may be able to check the work of the combiners
in the course of stamping the combined cards.

Only the obvious duplicates are eliminated. Whenever there is any
doubt involved in the decision of whether two cards are duplicates or not,
such cards are regarded as separate items and remain in the tray.

The routine for "Combining" follows: Each combiner takes a tray
and undertakes a card by card examination of all the cards in that tray,

[pagebreak.30]

checking the position of each card in relation to those cards which precede
and those which follow it. All like titles for the same author are compared.
If they agree with respect to title, edition, place, publisher, date of imprint and paging, they are clipped together, the best card\* on top, and are
placed end up at their correct position in the tray. Where a group of
authors of the same surname appears, all those author entries which have
only initials and those which have only the surname are carefully checked
with the succeeding cards in an attempt to find the author's complete name
which would place the cards with incomplete names in their proper positions.
Thousands of incomplete cards will be eliminated or completed through this
process.

In the case of serial publications only obvious duplicate cards are
combined. For example there may be a number of entries "The Times", a title
which is given to various publications throughout the English speaking world.
Where it is not possible to determine from the information on the cards
themselves, that the publications, to which reference is made, are identical,
the *Union List of Serials* should be consulted. The insertion of frequent
explanatory notes on colored cards in such places explaining the research
done, however limited, will guide future searchers and filers in the placement of any additional material in the file.

When all cards in a tray have been examined and duplicates have been
identified, a slip, giving the name of the combiner and the letters from
the tray label, is placed in the front of the tray which then is sent to
the stamper. The stamper checks the work of the combiner, examining each
group of cards before stamping all the symbols on the card placed first.

\* The best card of a group of duplicates is that card which is the most
complete and is most nearly in correct cataloging form. LC cards will
be considered the best cards in a group which includes both LC and
typed cards.

[pagebreak.31]

In checking the work of the combiner, any doubt about cards which the
combiner decided were duplicates, should be expressed by the stamper. Dates
must be checked for possible error. Frequentlv an eight is read for a three
and a three for an eight.

The average output per day per combiner is approximately one and a
ha1f trays (1500 cards per tray, and a six hour day). Any one day's output
depends, of course, upon the number of cards in the tray, and the difficulty
and complexity of the entries. However, a combiner may be expected to average
about six trays per week. Accordingly, ten combiners may be expected to process
sixty trays a week. There should be one stamper-reviser for not more than
*four* combiners, since the stamping and revising process must not be hurried.

## Use of Duplicate Cards

After the symbols have been placed on the best card, the stamper removes the duplicates and puts them aside face down, continuing this until the
end of the tray is reached. The process slip that accompanies the tray is
stamped "Discarded Duplicates" and is attached to the pack of duplicates removed. To this slip is added also the combiner's name and the inclusive
letters of the tray label. The packs of duplicate cards are tied with string
and stored in large cartons in rough alphabetical order.

The following uses of duplicate cards are suggested:

1. Replacement of manuscript or worn cards in catalogs of cooperating
libraries.

2. Added entries for joint authors, illustrators, editors and translaters for the union catalog if such entries are made subsequently.

Both of these suggestions require considerable testing, but in the
beginning stages of the compilation of a union catalog the uses are not to be
considered as of primary importance. Because of possible future use, perhaps
not yet apparent, duplicate cards should not be destroyed.

[pagebreak.32]

Because of the completeness of the information, duplicate LC cards
always should be segregated. In the event that duplicate LC cards are used
as suggested in item 2 preceding, each card should carry the location symbols
found on the identical LC card filed in the Uhion Catalog. Thus, if added entries
are made, the necessary location symbols are already on the cards.
