## Appendix H: SIMPLE FILING RULES

1. In filing, the parts of the card to be considered are (1) the author,
(2) the title, (3), date of publication. When there is no date, sometimes indicated by n.d., place undated cards before the dated ones.

2. In arranging authors with the same surname, file them according to their
given names.

3. As a general principle, always file cards giving incomplete information
before those which cover the same item thoroughly. Thus the name Drake
would be arranged:

	1. Drake, A.C.

	2. Drake, Andrew C.

	3. Drake, Andrew Charles

	4. Drake, Andrew Charles, 1906 -

However, if the titles under Drake, A.C. correspond to those under Drake,
Andrew Charles, 1906 -, file the Drake, A. C. cards with the Drake,
Andrew Charles, 1906 -, alphabetically by title.

4. Titles are arranged alphabetically by the first word not an article.
Place all like titles having the same date together; if the date varies,
arrange them chronologically, beginning with the earliest.

5. In alphabetizing, disregard the article at the beginning of the title,
but consider it in all other instances.

6. In case of like names representing persons, places or things the order
of filing is: (1) personal names, (2) place names, (3) titles.

7. Disregard titles of honor or designation such as, Mr., Mrs., Frau, Graf,
Count, Lord, Sir, etc.

8. Disregard hyphens in names; file as if the words were written separately.

9. File abbreviated words as if spelled out. File *Mc* as if spelled *Mac*.

10. When two or more authors are given in the heading, disregard all but the
first.

11. When a title begins with a numeral, file it as if the numeral were spelled
out.

12. Disregard all diacritical marks, such as accents, apostrophes, etc. File
them as if they were written without any mark. The umlaut (¨) is an
exception to this rule: File as though the vowel were ae, oe, ue, (ä, ö,
ü,) also file the Swedish å as aa.

13. Do not follow directions on cross-reference cards. File cross-reference
cards before the author and title cards.
