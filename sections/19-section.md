## Appendix L: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PRINTED CATALOG CARDS

Library of Congress printed catalog cards can be found in the
catalogs of most of the libraries in the country. Completely authoritative,
these cards raise the standard and effectiveness of any library catalog in
which they are included.

Produced by the Cataloging Division of the Library of Congress,
the cards may be obtained through the Library's Card Division. Cards are
made for all books copyrighted in the United States. In addition, through
a cooperative cataloging scheme, the stock of Library of Congress printed
cards is enlarged by there being produced catalog cards for a great mass of
significant materials found in the collections of the cooperating libraries.

If it is decided to use LC cards in the compilation of the Union
Catalog the planning committee for the catalog should contact the Card
Division of the Library of Congress. The cost of LC cards varies with
the total number of cards ordered and with the arrangement of the order.
The *Handbook of Card Distribution*, issued by the Card Division, gives
complete instruction for placing card orders.

LC cards, the product of standardized and best cataloging methods,
can be an important factor in determining the quality and authoritativeness
of the Union Catalog. A nucleus of LC cards (1) assists in the solution of
filing arrangement which, in part, depends upon accuracy and completeness
of entries, (2) will aid the differentiation of authors with similar names
which present a real problem in union catalogs, (3) tends to unify similar
entries into a logical arrangement even if typescript cards are incomplete,
(4) reduces the problems and length of time in final revision of the catalog,
(5) avoids much duplication in the typing process since it will not be

[pagebreak.L-2]

be necessary to copy a large percentage of the LC cards appearing on the film
and (6) most important, the nucleus of LC cards supplies technical standards
contributing to the permanency of the catalog.

From the initial ordering to final incorporation of LC cards in the
Union Catalog, the following procedure is employed:

(1) Before any transcribing by the typing unit, the films containing
LC cards are segregated from those not containing LC cards. From
the latter films the order number is taken from each LC card
found in the Course of a card by card examination of these films.
Each number is pencilled on a separate slip. Order numbers should
not be taken for LC cards where the edition, imprint, etc., has
been altered by the individual library. These altered cards will
typed in the transcribing process.

(2) The card numbers, are arranged according to the instructions
found in the *Handbook of Card Distribution*, and sent to the
Card Division as an order for LC cards.

(3) Upon receipt, the LC cards are sorted, alphabetized and filed in
a separate file.

(4) The LC cards next are checked against the library films for
assigning location symbols to them.

(5) Location symbols are stamped on the LC cards and filed into the
Union Catalog trays.

In connection with the operation indicated under (4) above the
following notes may be of assistance:

(1) A typist is assigned a film from which a portion of the LC
order has been made. This film is checked with the corresponding trays of LC cards. Working from the unaltered LC

[pagebreak.L-3]

cards on the film to those in the tray, all cards found in the
tray correspond with those on the film are accepted as
correct duplications if the information below the author line
and above the collation correspond. These cards are turned
end-up; in the tray. Any LC cards on the film not found in
the tray are typed and inserted in their proper position. If
an old LC card on the film agrees with a new LC card among the
cards ordered, except for a title variance, accept the new LC
entry only if the specific title variance is given on it under
the note "title varies."

(2) As indicated above, it is necessary to type a card when a
corresponding card is not present in the LC order. If the LC
card to be typed contains an old form of an entry, type it,
using the form of the entry found on one of the new LC cards,
which represents a work of the same author, e.g., film shows:
*Bennett, Enoch Arnold*: latest form according to LC card:
*Bennett, Arnold*. Substitute the latter. In the same manner
if the author's dates are not present on the film, and it is
necessary to type the card insert the dates found on the LC
card representing a work by the same author.

(3) When the checking of LC cards with the library films is completed,
the film containers are stamped, *LC Record Completed*. The *Film
Record* also is marked, *LC Record Completed*.
