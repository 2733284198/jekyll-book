## Appendix B: RECORDS KEPT BY PHOTOGRAPHING CREW

### Day by day count of trays selected and photographed

Sample 1

----------------------------------
Date  No.\ of  No.\Â of Cover
        Trays    Cards
---- -------- -------- -----------
2/3        40    4,901 A - Cam

2/4        36    5,190 Cam-Dow

2/5        35    5,285 Dow-Eva

2/6        32    5,003 Eva-Gen
----------------------------------

The number of trays, which may be expected to be processed daily by
one photographing crew varies from 30 to 55, depending upon the contents of each
tray, the frequency of the occurance of main entries, and upon the number of
hours worked. Likewise the total of cards photographed daily varies. To illustrate one of these influencing factors, that of tray contents, the heading
Europe is cited. Here, although the majority of entries are subject entries,
there must be followed the same careful process of a card by card examination
which may produce only two or three main entries.

### Film record

Sample 2

University of Nebraska Library

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Reel\ No. Film\ No. Section           No.\ of\ Cards Date\ Mailed 
                    Covered
--------- --------- ---------------- --------------- ------------
1.        1.        A-Barq                     5,200 2/3/39

          2.        Barq-Car                   5,188 2/4/39

2.        3.        Car-Eva                    4,988 2/5/39

          4.        Eva-Gen                    5,003 2/6/39
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This record not only keeps a daily account of work done, but also
records the daily "incorporation" of film on the project. The two records answer the

[pagebreak.B-2]

question of the number of trays processed daily and serve as a check on the
portion of the catalog covered both by day and by each film, of which two
or more 100' lengths frequently are used in one day's operation.
