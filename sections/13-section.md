## Appendix F: INSTRUCTIONS FOR TYPING CARDS

1. The cards are to be copied in regular library form, as indicated
by the samples. *Do not follow irregular forms found on the library
film.*

2. Leave three-quarters of an inch margin along the left-hand edge of
card.

3. Copy the author's full name and dates just as they appear on the
film, leaving eight (8) spaces after each initial, in the absence
of either or both given names. If the author's name runs over
to a second or third line, each of these lines indented eight (8)
spaces, counting from the first letter of the author's surname.

4. Copy the title as it appears on the film, indenting four spaces,
starting under the first letter of the author's surname. Long titles
(more than 4 or 5 lines) may be abbreviated only with the permission
and at the discretion of the supervisor.

fic Ocean, performed in the years 1796-1797,

16. Copy corporate entries as they are written. If the entry has a
subdivision, copy the subdivision two spaces after the first part.

[pagebreak.F-7]

17. Serial publications. These are publications which appear at regular
intervals, i.e., weekly, monthly, bimonthly, yearly, etc. In order
to save space in the union catalog trays, only one card is made with
an "open entry" i.e. "v.1" and the date of first publication followed
by a dash instead of making a card for each issue of the serial. On
many serial cards, however, the film will indicate final volumes and
dates in pencil. Copy only the initial volume and initial date, using
dashes followed by four spaces.
