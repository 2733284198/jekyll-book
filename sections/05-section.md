## CHAPTER III OPERATION OF THE TYPING AND FILING UNITS

The typing section consists of one or more units, each being
composed of a supervisor and twenty typists. The number of units employed depends upon the size of the catalog and the time within which the
catalog is to be completed.

Typewriters with pica-type are recommended, since heavy record
ribbon, which produces the darkest and clearest impressions, can be used.
The cards produced are easy to read and will maintain a maximum legibility
over a long period of time with the special type of ink with which the heavy
record ribbon is impregnated. This is important if it ever becomes necessary
to photograph the completed union catalog.

## Training of typists

It is important that each typist understand the basic conceptions
in the preparation of the union catalog and the reasons for the existence of
a union catalog. Since most of the typists will not be familiar with library
methods, the success of the transcribing depends upon the clarity and simplicity
of explanation. To effect this, the supervisor may find it advantageous to employ a simple adaptation of standard library terminology and be governed by the
probable viewpoint of the inexperienced worker.

A personal interview, immediately, with each newly assigned typist
is suggested. This interview should include a brief explanation of the purpose
of the union catalog. It should be emphasized that the union catalog includes
only one author card for each book and that the omission of even one card is
a vital error. This may be followed with an explanation of the preparation of
the films and a description of the photographic equipment. If a photograph of
the photographing unit is available, this could be shown to the typist. The
projector and a sample reel should then be shown. It is necessary to explain

[pagebreak.16]

that the light used in the projector is not too dim and that working from the
screen impairs the vision in no way. Often the worker's first reaction is
that it is impossible to see all the words on the screen. After the introduction, proceed with instruction in the typing process.[^05-1]

Under no circumstances should the period of typing readjustment be
rushed. A careful, step by step, instruction period, using the easiest
examples first, results in a more rapid attainment of working efficiency. The
typist should understand that efficient work is expected and for this reason
a reasonable amount of time will be allowed for absorption of the technique
and for becoming familiar with the routine. In the interests of project
*esprit de corp*, there must be created in the typist an understanding and
respect for the work assigned in order to avoid an attitude that it is either
too difficult or too easy.

Experience with union cataloging projects has demonstrated that,
with proper instruction, the work may be mastered and performed with excellent
results by typists with less than a high-school education.

Each typist should be given a copy of *Definitions of Cataloging
Terms* (Appendix E) and *Instructions for Typing Of Cards* (Appendix F). The
supervisor should explain the *Definitions*, illustrating the parts of the card
with Library of Congress or handwritten cards obtained from a contributing
library.

In acquainting typists with the provisions of the *Instructions* it
will be found convenient first to drill the typist in items one through
sixteen. After these are mastered, instruction may be given in items

[pagebreak.17]

seventeen through twenty.

[^05-1]: Ascertain typing experience and how long the interval since last operating
a typewriter. If this period exceeds a year, an hour or so a day should be
given to renew facility in the touch system. Average typing skill is a necessary
prerequisite if reasonably efficient operation is to be attained at the outset.
Workers without basic typing skill may never be adequate since there arises the
further complication of learning the technique of copying library catalog cards
according to standard forms.

Typists next are given selected groups of miscellaneous entries
which are transcribed for practice. Each typist then attempts the revision
of the work, with the help of the supervisor who points out every error,
however minute, and explains why it is an error. It is better procedure to
have the typist practice transcribing from actual cards, covering all examples,
than from the film itself.[^05-2]

The length of the instructional period varies with each typist.
The establishment of facility with technique and of self-confidence requires
the patience and careful attention of the supervisor for from three days to
a week. After sufficient skill is developed by practice, a film and projector
are assigned to the typist.

[^05-2]: The following reasons which may be obvious, are given: (1) The typist is not
so likely to suffer the hesitancy and nervousness which attend a first approach
to the film. (2) A chance is given to master all examples at one time, while
the usual run of the film will not always expose all examples. (3) Confidence
is gained in copying the form. (4) The typist's confidence is increased and stabilized by the knowledge gained from frequent tests on the written or printed
cards. Now, confronted with the film, the typist acquires assurance and ease;
fear of the inability to read the film results in pride upon discovering that
the forms can be handled and the film read. Typing from the cards themselves
proves to be of such value psychologically that the importance of a collection
of sample cards cannot be over-emphasized in the period of work adjustment.

[pagebreak.18]

## Typing cards from film

The laboratory, to which the film has been sent by the photographic
unit, will develop the film in 100-foot lengths, unless otherwise instructed,
and forward it to the typing headquarters of the project.

For each roll of developed film received at the typing headquarters,
there is made an identifying card upon which will be recorded the beginning
and completion of its typing (Appendix D, sample 1). This card is filed
alphabetically by the name of the library.

To each film container is attached a label carrying the film number,
the name of the library and the portion of the alphabet covered by the
photographed cards (Appendix D, sample 2).

One worker then is detailed to examine the film, card by card, for
any blurred or illegible takes. This initial process must not be delayed,
since, if the record of blurred cards is sent to the photographing crew
immediately, re-takes can be made while the crew still is in the library
concerned, and before they have moved to the next library catalog designated
for photographing.

A *Work record card* is prepared for each typist (Appendix D, sample 3).
This carries the name of the typist, and the name of the supervisor, and
space is provided for information concerning the film assigned to the typist.
When work is begun on a film, the typist's name, and date of film assignment, are entered on the *Film file card*. (Appendix D, sample 1). At the
same time the description of the film assigned is entered on the typist's
*Work record card*, which is kept by the project supervisor in a companion
file to the *Film file* cards. When the film roll has been transcribed, the
date of completion is entered on the typist's *Work record card*.

[pagebreak.19]

## Proof-reading of typed cards

At the conclusion of a day's work, each typist presents his group
of cards to the supervisor with the *Typist's daily process slip* attached
(Appendix D, sample 4). This process slip remains with the group of cards
until filed in the catalog. Each day the supervisor revises the cards
produced the preceding day by his group of typists, making a card by card
inspection. For the first week or ten days of a typist's work with a film,
each card is reviewed by direct comparison with the film. This process
reveals any erroneous ideas or misconceptions conceived during the instructional period. It also reveals any tendency on the part of the typist to
read dates incorrectly and most importantly, any tendency toward inadvertent
omission of detail. Except for the first week or ten days of a new worker's
typing, proof-reading with the film is largely unnecessary, and if continued,
would result an inordinate consumption of the supervisor's time, as well
as that of the worker.[^05-3]

[^05-3]: The typist remains idle unless there is a double set of projectors
allowing the typist to work on another film during the course of this
film revision. From the standpoint of the supervisor it requires about
two hours to revise the daily production of one typist, with the result
that revision would fall hopelessly in arrears, and worker supervision
would be seriously impaired. In the final revision of the Union Library
Catalog of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, it is found that from 25-50 percent of the cards require additional information or complete
changes. A careful check of these cards with the original film has
indicated that the majority of those required changes are not due to any
appreciable extent, to typing errors, but more often because the original card contained the errors or lacked the necessary information. Experience in final revision indicates that too much checking with the
film not only wastes time and retards production, but also is of little
real value ultimately. In combining duplicates, many more or less complete cards, or cards with minor typographical errors, which have been
missed in the process of revision, are eliminated by utilizing the authoritative L.C. cards, or copies thereof.

[pagebreak.20]

After the period of 'card-film' revision, the supervisor, depending
upon professional training, rapidly revises cards without constant reference
to the film copies. Any discovered mis-spellings are indicated on a paper
slip (referred to as a P-slip) which is placed in front of the card containing the error and together are turned end up in the pack of cards produced by a given typist. Revisions completed, the pack is returned to the
typist, who is required to make the corrections immediately. If the card
appears to be wrong in form, or if the spelling of foreign language words
appears to be incorrect or unusual, the supervisor indicates on the slip
that the film is to be consulted. The typist, consulting the care record
of the film, obtains the film, and, with the supervisor, the difficulty is
explained, and the correction indicated.

Examples of most frequent types of errors.

III. If card is completely irregular, let supervisor see film.

[pagebreak.21]

Corrections are then made and the cards returned to supervisor, with
correction slip and corrected card still standing end up in the pack.
Rather than re-type a card for typographical errors the typist may use
either an eraser or a scratcher (single blade razor) and insert the correct
letter as neatly as possible. The supervisor checks corrections and indicates that the pack of cards is revised by writing "Revised" (followed by
initials) on the *process slip* attached to the pack of cards.

The cards are now ready for the stamping process.

(For production records and their evaluation see Appendix I).

## Stamping Process

After typed cards have been finally revised by the supervisor, they
are routed to one worker in the typing headquarters who stamps the cards
with a symbol denoting the library in which the books, represented by the
cards, are found. These symbols are carefully rubber-stamped in the left-hand margin of the cards.

The qualifications of a good stamper are patience, neatness, and
capacity for painstaking routine. The stamping job is not a tedious
occupation for the ideal person. He or she enjoys doing a minute job well
and is willing to take the time to make each stamp a small but perfect
unit of a large undertaking.

The training given a stamper is quite simple. A key to the symbols
used and an explanation of the various stamps is supplied. In the case of
some large libraries which have departmental libraries, various symbols are
used in the main catalog to indicate the location of the books in the separate
departmental libraries. If the union library catalog is to show locations
in departmental libraries, the typist marks these special symbols in the
lower left-hand corner of his typed card, thus indicating, to the stamper,

[pagebreak.22]

the stamp which this card requires in order to differentiate it from the
cards for books in the main library only. The importance of these stamps
and symbols is explained to the stamper by pointing out how their purpose
in locating books would be defeated, if the wrong symbol were stamped on
cards.

Accuracy and a steady hand are essential. The process involving the
least waste motion and the least handling is as follows:

The cards, revised by the supervisor and corrected by the typists
the preceding day, are gathered and routed to the stamper who, by observing
the process slip on each pack of cards, arranges the packs by the names of
libraries, for the orderly stamping of the library name symbols on the cards.

The rubber band is removed from a pack and about the top thirty cards
are taken in the hands. This group is "fanned" so that the bottom edge of
each card, from top to the bottom of the pack, slightly overlaps the card
immediately beneath, the lapping margins unbalancing the pack toward the
stamper. The stamp is pressed in the ink pad with the right hand, followed
by the stamping of the symbol in the upper left-hand margin of the card. As
the right hand returns to the pad, the left hand turns the top card over
face-down above the top edge of the pack, thus making ready the next card for
stamping. This method has proved the speediest, keeps the cards in order,
and prevents waste motion.

Two types of stamp-pads are used in rubber-stamping: slow drying,
and quick drying. The quick drying inks tend to fade more rapidly than the
slow drying inks. Since impressions made from the slow drying pad smear in
a rapid-stamping operation, the use of the quick-drying pad is recommended.

Since the total number of cards in each back is marked on the pack
when it is routed to the stamper, the total of number of cards stamped daily
can be readily computed.

[pagebreak.23]

The most important and exacting duty for a stamper is the preparation
of combined cards, or the stamping on a single card all of the symbols which
appear on duplicate cards. This procedure is explained subsequently. (*Combining of duplicate cards*, p. 29). This process coming after the typing of
all cards is completed, the supervisor will be familiar with the abilities
of the stamper and will be able to select the most intelligent and capable
person in the group for this special work.

## Cards in Non-Roman Alphabet

An uniform procedure for handling cards in non-Roman alphabets must
be established at the beginning of the project and strict adherence to it
must be maintained throughout the compilation of the union catalog.

All cards in non-Roman alphabet are marked by punching the margin of
the film opposite the frame in which such cards are read. Immediately upon
discovery, the typist draws such cards to the attention of the one worker
in the typing unit who is responsible for punching the film margin. The
supervisor keeps a record of the non-Roman alphabet cards on each film.
These cards are subsequently located by running the film through the projector while holding the two edges between the thumb and forefinger. Each
of the V-shaped nicks is felt and acts as a signal to stop and inspect a
card. When the typing of a film, which contains such punches, is completed,
the film box is stamped *Includes cards in Non-Roman alphabet*. The supervisor
prepares a list of the individual alphabets included and places this list
in the box with the film.

If a supervisor can write Greek it will not be necessary to punch
the film for cards containing material in Greek. The typist transcribes
that portion of the cards which is in Roman alphabet letters and the Greek
letters are inserted in ink by the supervisor.

[pagebreak.24]

The film should be punched for cards which bear Chinese and Japanese
characters. However, the Roman alphabet sections of such cards are typed,
leaving a margin of about 2" on the right-hand side. These cards are
stamped with the library's symbol and kept in a separate alphabetized group
for a student of oriental languages to insert the Chinese and Japanese directly from the film. Cards in Russian and other Slavic languages are to
be copied in ink by a student of these languages.

In lieu of transcribing non-Roman alphabet cards as outlined above,
the library at which the cards were originally made, may be requested to supply duplicates for the union catalog, either through the original source,
or through the preparation of photostatic copies. If the non-Roman alphabet
cards are LC printed cards, it is desirable to order duplicates from the
Library of Congress.

In employing either of the above suggested methods for transcribing
non-Roman cards, each alphabet completed is crossed from the alphabet list
placed in the box by the supervisor. When the non-Roman alphabets are completed, the box is stamped "Finished" opposite the stamp "Includes cards in
non-Roman alphabet."

## Filing Procedure

The size of the filing section depends upon the number of typists employed to produce cards. In general, it will be found that five filers can
keep pace with a typing staff of twenty.

The qualifications of the filers are perseverance, capacity for detail
and mental alertness. Previous experience, while desirable, is not necessary.
The filing procedure in a union library catalog differs so greatly from
other types of filing that it is difficult to find filers whose previous
experience proves of value, except in being familiar with the alphabet and
in being at ease in handling numerous items.

[pagebreak.25]

A preliminary personal interview with prospective filers, explaining
the purpose of the union catalog, and supplying careful instruction in the
parts of the catalog card, assist in establishing an adequate understanding
of the work.

Usually there will be three operations in the arrangement of cards
into desired order: sorting, alphabetizing and filing. *Sorting* is the
division of the cards of one letter group into smaller groups up to the
second or third letter. *Alphabetizing* is the refinement of "sorting",
placing each card in its exact alphabetical relationship with all other
cards of a group. *Filing* is the placing of the sorted and alphabetized
cards into the trays of the catalog in their correct positions, relative
to those cards already filed into the catalog trays.

The supervisor should instruct the filers in the technique and rules
to be followed, using as a guide the instructions, "*Simple Filing Procedure*"
(Appendix G), and, "*Simple Filing Rules*" (Appendix E).

It is suggested that all filers be assigned first to "sorting."
After thorough drill in sorting cards of a single letter group to the
third or even as far as the fourth letter, the filers should alphabetize
exactly the individual groups for filing. In practice, it will usually
be found that the mechanical arrangement outlined in "Simple Filing Procedure" is not necessary after the third letter, for, as the groups of
cards become smaller, the filer scans by words rather than by letters.
The more export workers should perform the filing operation while the
remaining workers perform the sorting and alphabetizing operations. As
the sorters acquire more skill, they may be assigned to perform all three
operations.

[pagebreak.26]

While numerous lists of filing rules, to assist in the filing of
catalog cards, are available, it is frequently difficult to use them as
guides of instruction to filers for a large union catalog. Standard filing
rules specify procedure not only for author and title but also for subject
and secondary entries. They also presuppose a catalog card which is correct
in all respects, including punctuation and details of personal names and dates.
Such consistency or detail cannot always be assured in a union catalog which is
derived from a variety of sources. The "Simple Filing Rules" (Appendix H) are
therefore designed as a guide in handling entries of this type. Those rules,
together with a list of articles in foreign languages which are to be ignored
in the filing, will cover most of the entries encountered. Where a point is
not covered by those rules, the card should be referred to the supervisor for
decision.

## Organization for Filing

In compiling a small union catalog for which the typing unit consists
of not more than forty typists, it is best to have all the typists work on the
films of the same library (preferably the largest library) until that library's
cards are completely transcribed. These cards are arranged in trays and form
a basic file for the whole union catalog. Following this course, only two or
three filers will be needed at the beginning of the project. The filers can be
taught the routine necessary for arranging those cards as a basic file for the
union library catalog. Thus initially trays are set-up to cover the whole
alphabet. These new filers alphabetize the cards to correspond to the arrangement of the cards on the film and any variations peculiar to the library's
catalog arrangement are adjusted to conform with the standards adopted for the
union catalog. However on a project with a greater personnel, designed for

[pagebreak.27]

constructing a large catalog, it is not possible to have all typists work at the
same time on the films of one library to form a basic file. As a result the
sorting and alphabetizing of cards from more than one library, must proceed
immediately. Filing is undertaken without a basic file in which to interfile.
As the card packs arrive from the typists, revised and stamped, they are
grouped according to the letter of the alphabet to which they belong. All those
which cover a miscellaneous range of letters are segregated and sorted immediately.

The most efficient method of handling large masses of cards covering
all sections of the alphabet and issuing from several films, is that of having
all the filers work on the same letter in the same operation, until that letter
is completed, i.e., all filers sort, all filers alphabetize, all filers file,
the some letter group. If the filing unit is large, the filers may be divided
into teams of eight or ten, each group being responsible for one letter.

Whatever procedure it is necessary to employ in building up a basic
file, the following mechanical processes are observed by all filers. In every
operation the filer counts the number of cards handled. Upon picking up a
group of cards, the filer measures its thickness from which the number of cards
in the group is determined according to a previous counting of the number of
cards of the particular stock there is in a pack one inch thick. The count per
inch varies from 80-95 cards. This count is recorded on a slip of paper, which
is turned in at the end of the day, and which shows the work accomplished in
terms of number of cards sorted, number of cards alphabetized, number of cards
filed, and number of cards refiled if any errors are found in the cards already
filed in the catalog. One filer is designated to arrange guide cards, while
another filer is made responsible for the labelling, expanding, and the consoli-

[pagebreak.28]

dation of trays, which at no time should be filled to more than two-thirds of
their capacity. The supervisor should explain that the labels must not omit any
possible combination of letters, e.g., A-Ap, followed by Aq-Ars, Art-Aus, Aut-Az.

## Special Filing Problems

It is difficult to arrange the cards for classical authors alphabetically,
i.e., Aesopus, Aristoteles, etc., whose works are published in a number of
languages and editions. The Union Library Catalog of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area has found it convenient to file cards for these authors according
to the date of publication, without regard to title. Editions of identical
years are arranged alphabetically by place of publication. A similar procedure
should be followed for "Voluminous" authors, where the number of editions may
be troublesome in the identification of duplicate cards for the combining
process which is the initial step in the final revision of the catalog. This
method facilitates the combining of duplicate cards and is mastered easily by
the filers.

Another problem is the separation of corporate, official and title
headings. State, city, title and society entries for New York constitute
a puzzling example of this. Official publications followed by corporate and
title entries should be established as the sequence of arrangement for entries
of this type.

The U. S. headings furnish a similar problem in arrangement. The
Nebraska Union Catalog project is attempting the following procedure as a
possible solution: Guide cards and cross-reference cards are typed from *United
States Author Headings Including Those Adopted by the Library of Congress as
Appearing in the Union Catalog, compiled by George A. Schwegmann, Jr.* The
filers then file all United States entries according to those guides and cross-
references, rather than according to the headings appearing on the typed cards,
which are often reversed, out-of-date or inconsistent.
