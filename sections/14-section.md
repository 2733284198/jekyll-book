## Appendix G: SIMPLE FILING PROCEDURE

The following steps should be followed in all filing and preliminary
sorting of cards:

1. Sort all cards into the following 25 letter groups:

--- --- --- --- ----
 A   F   K   P   U
 B   G   L   Q   V
 C   H   M   R   W
 D   I   N   S   XY
 E   J   O   T   Z
--------------------

Disregard the initial article, i. e., *the*, *a*, *an*, and corresponding
articles in foreign languages, and such initials as *I*., *K*., *K.K.*, and
*R*. in connection with the names of societies, institutions, etc.

2. Take up each of the twenty-five groups of cards in succession
and sort them further by second letter; thus Aa, Ab, Ac, Ad, etc.
Repeat this for the third, fourth, and fifth letter if necessary.

3. For final alphabetizing of each group, pick up the cards in your
right hand and spread them out fan-wise so that you may see all
the headings readily. Then with your left hand make whatever changes
and adjustments may be necessary.

4. After completing a group, place the cards apart -- face downward --
and proceed with the next group. When this new group is finished,
add it to the already completed cards, face downward. Repeat this
process until all cards have been alphabetized.

5. In the actual filing of the cards in the trays, it is essential to
pay special attention to three items on the card. The author, the
title, and the date.

A. *Author* 
: The author's name, whether personal, or coporate,
is the chief and the first thing to be considered.
If two authors are given, disregard the second. In
other words all tne works by the same author should
be found in one place.

B. *Title* 
: After finding the author's place in the tray, consider the title of the work. Disregard the initial
article. File the titles of works by the same author
in alphabetical order.

C. *Date* 
: There will be many identical titles of a single
author. File them together if the date is the same.
When the date varies, arrange them chronologically.
The earlier editions preceding the later ones.
