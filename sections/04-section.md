## CHAPTER II. OPERATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT

The photographing crew consists of two selectors and one operator
for each camera used. The qualifications of these workers are mental
alertness and a manual speed. The operator must be quick with his hands
and have some interest and skill in mechanical processes.

Each worker should be interviewed when he comes to the job, and should
be given a brief explanation of the purpose of the union catalog, of the
methods of operation of the project, and of the equipment to be used. The
crew's interest and cooperation can be aroused by pointing out the attractive
features of the work, such as moving from library to library, and by explaining
the responsibility resting in the photographic unit, upon the work of which
the success of the entire undertaking depends.

The workers should be taught the forms of the various types of cards.
The form of secondary entries, which are not to be photographed, as distinguished from the main entries which are to be photographed, should be
emphasized by the use of examples of main author and title cards, secondary
editor, joint author, illustrator, and title cards; together with a number
of subject cards; part with subjects in red ink, and part in the capitalized
black ink headings used in some libraries.

The *Definitions of cataloging terms* (Appendix E) are explained carefully using sample cards to illustrate the terms used. This supplies a
good background for the selection, and helps familiarize the selectors with
the terms which they will find used in the *Instructions for selecting cards
to be photographed for union catalog* (Appendix A).

The next step is a careful item by item explanation of the *Instructions*.
The sample forms are used again for this explanation. After this brief but

[pagebreak.9]

comprehensive study, actual selection is made from the library catalog
first designated.

The crew goes to the library with the supervisor, who has discussed
previously the variations and peculiarities of the library's catalog with the
head cataloger. This facilitates the explanation to the workers, and leaves
no doubt in the supervisor's mind in answering the selectors' questions.
The crew should practice the selection of cards to be filmed. After the
supervisor has explained any situations peculiar to the particular catalog
which will influence the selection procedure, one of the crew members
takes a tray and starts a card by card examination of its contents, the
supervisor and the other two members of the crew watching each decision.

The cards which are to be photographed are turned end up on the
right hand side of the tray. Any errors or questions are clarified and
explained on the spot. The supervisor watches the two other crew ink
follow the same procedure. After each crew member has completed a tray,
the process is continued, with each member working independently with a
tray. Each worker checks another's work at its conclusion. This learning
process takes about a week. It is tedious, but sound and effective; and
the three members of the crew establish a sense of cooperation among themselves from the outset.

### The photographing process

The photographing crew should be allotted a space near the main
catalog, with room for the machine, and a small table at which the
selectors may work. A representative of the photographic machine company
or other person skilled in the operation of the machine should be present

[pagebreak.10]

to set up the equipment, and to teach *all three members of the crew*[^04-1] the
routine of the film loading and unloading of the camera and the methods
of making mechanical adjustments which are frequently necessary in the
course of operation.

[^04-1]: In case of illness or absence of the operator chosen the others should
know how to operate the machine. The operator should not be selected
until the photographic machine company representative and the supervisor can see which one of the three shows the greatest aptitude for the
photographing. Thus, all three are taught to select, and all are given
a chance to operate the machine. By the second day the most efficient
operator may be chosen.

When a selector has up-ended all author cards in a tray, the
photographer places the tray on the shelf of the machine. The machine
operator first runs three exposures of a date card. This date card carries
the name of the union catalog, the name of the library, and for the purpose of recording when the film roll was exposed, the date upon which the
machine operates. The some practice is followed at the beginning of each
day's work and always at the end of the film. This identifies the film
for all time and the date cards scattered throughout the film keep a check
on the individual worker.

The operator now is ready to photograph the cards selected in the
first tray. He removes the first card or cards and inserts a marker card
(heavy blue guide cards are recommended) to keep the place in the tray.
If there are two or more author cards together, he takes out the cards and
slides them one by one, face up, into the machine along the guide in the
trough. The guide is carefully set so that the cards will be near the
center of the film with enough margin on the unperforated side of the film
for possible checks and notes which may be made in the future. The cards

[pagebreak.11]

will go into the machine straight if they are held at a point above the
punched hole through which the tray guide-rod passes. The card is photographed
and drops face down in a trough by the operator's knees. If it is a single
author card, followed immediately in the tray by a secondary card or cards
which are not up-ended, the card is picked out of the trough and put back
in its proper place in the tray. Where several author cards appear together,
not separated by secondary cards, they will be fed into the machine one after
another. They will then fall into the trough in the order in which they go
through the machine. Because they fall face downward, they are in proper
order for returning to the catalog tray. When the operator reaches the end
of the group, the cards may be picked up in a group and returned to the tray
where the marker is holding the place. The operator then photographs the
next up-ended card, or group of cards, returns them to the tray, until all
cards selected are filmed. If this procedure is followed carefully, the
catalog cannot be disarranged in any way. As soon as the photographing of
a tray is completed, the guide rod must be inserted and the tray immediately
returned to its proper place in the catalog.[^04-2]

[^04-2]: Under no circumstances are any trays to be left unphotographed at the end
of the day. To avoid any waste of time, it has been found of help to have
the operator report for work one half hour later in the morning than the
selectors. There are then several trays for him to start work on immediately, and by staying a half hour later in the afternoon all the trays selected
on that day can be easily finished. Thus the number of trays selected each
day is identical with the number photographed each day.

After the supervisor has had an opportunity to judge the preferences
and aptitudes of the crew members, the machine instructor will redrill the
best operator in the rudiments handling the equipment. Thus the members
of the photographing unit properly assigned now can be expected to function
with the greatest efficiency possible.

[pagebreak.12]

### Records maintained by photographic unit

For uniformity, accuracy, and promptness the responsibility for
keeping records is given to one of the two selectors of the photographic crew.

Each selector assigned to selecting the cards to be photographed,
keeps an individual record of the number of trays in which selection is
made daily. The selector, in addition, notes the part of the alphabet
covered in the selection process.

At the end of the working day, the official record keeper for the
unit cumulates the two tray selection records, checks the part of the
alphabet reported covered, takes from the photographing machine the count
of the exposures made which equals the number of cards photographed, and
produces the *Day by day record of trays selected and photographed* (Appendix B,
sample 1). As indicated in the footnote (p. 11) the number of trays in which
cards are selected equals the number of trays photographed each day.

For the *Film record* (Appendix B, sample 2) the record-keeper notes
the alphabetical position of the first card photographed when the machine
operator makes the exposure of the first frame of the 200' film reel with
which the photographing machine has just been loaded.

Similarly, the alphabetical position of the last card photographed
in the last frame of each 100' film strip is noted, as well as the count of
the total number of cards contained thereon as shown by the machine counter.

As noted, the *Film record* carries a serial number for each 200' reel
and a serial numbering for each 100' of film. This latter numbering is
possible since the photographing machine signals the passage of each 100'
of film, at which point the film is cut.

The *Day by day record* and *Film record*, both of which are essential
to the efficiency of the photographing operation, are picked up by the

[pagebreak.13]

project supervisor daily or weekly.

These regular visits by the supervisor also are made to correct
any operating difficulties being experienced by the photographing crew.
All problems are noted and entered in the *Individual library description
appraisal and record of microfilming* (Appendix C) maintained by the project
supervisor.

At the conclusion of the day's work the films are boxed and sent to
the laboratory for developing.[^04-3] The boxes are marked with the name and address
of the union catalog, and marked lightly in pencil with the name of the library
catalog represented by the cards photographed on the enclosed film and with the
section of the alphabet covered by the photographed cards. This assists in
identifying each roll of developed film if it is returned with several others.
The laboratory returns the developed film to the catalog typing headquarters in
100' lengths,[^04-4] unless instructed to cut the film differently. This latter
course, not uncommon, is necessary then a given 100' of film contains exposures
for cards taken from more than one library catalog.

[^04-3]: The films are either mailed out by the machine operator every day, or they
are collected and shipped daily by the project supervisor. This procedure depends upon the number of photographing units. If there are several crews in
operation in different locations, then the films should be collected and shipped
together. If there is only one crew, the operator, with mailing supplies, can
be responsible for the marking and mailing.

[^04-4]: To reduce storage difficulties and to keep recording at a minimum, and to
meet the limitations of the capacity film projectors which usually accommodate
film rolls containing a 100' of film or less, it is advisable to cut the film
in not less than 100' lengths. At the conclusion of photographing one library,
some unexposed film may remain in the camera. Without removing the exposed
portion of the film from the camera, photographing commences in the next library
with the exposure of a slip instructing the developing laboratory to cut the
film, at this point. This results in the 100' roll of developed film being
sent, to the typing headquarters, in two short sections and on separate spools,
each of which contains the exposures of only one library catalog. In this
circumstance only is there any necessity for cutting the film less than 100'
lengths. Typing speed is not increased by cutting film in short lengths, since
the number of cards to be transcribed remains the same, and time is saved with
the 100' lengths by reducing the frequency of projector loading, which is
accompanied by a lag in worker production.

[pagebreak.14]

When the developed film rolls are received at the typing headquarters a worker is assigned to check and examine the film, card by card
in order to discover illegible or blurred cards. If the photographers are
still located in the library, represented by the film found illegible, a
record of the cards blurred is made and referred to the photographing unit
for re-takes. Finally the worker, checking the film, labels the film
container and a card is made for the film file. (Appendix D, samples 1 \& 2)
