The information required by the first part of this record is gathered by the professional supervisor of the union cataloging project.

Under the heading, *Characteristics of the Library*, should appear a
clear analysis of the cooperating library's holdings, the general collection,
special collections and other unique features.

Under the heading, Characteristics of Catalog, should be found a
frank estimate of the library's catalog including all peculiarities of the library

[pagebreak.C-2]

cataloging practices, standard and unorthodox, as well as incorrect variations
from standardized forms.

The above information, gathered prior to project operation, is of
value in the instruction of the photographing crew and forms the basis upon
which general instructions are supplied to typists who are assigned the film
from a given library.

The second part of this form supplies a history of the photographing
operation and a record of the plans of the library to cooperate with the
union catalog.

Thus this form is the basis of a complete history of the union
catalog's relationship with a cooperating library both before and after the
project is in operation. These records of all libraries are kept confidential
and are used by the union cataloging staff only. Usually supplementary sheets
are necessary to make a complete record.
