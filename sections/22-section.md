## Appendix - O: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHOTOGRAPHING UNIT

In operating a statewide union library catalogue project it is advisable
to arrange the working periods of the "Photographers" of the Photographing Unit
so that the equipment will not be idle any appreciable length of time. If only
one photographing machine, employing one operator, is in service, working time
requrements for the operator and the time lost in moving the machine, result
in an uneconomical use of the equipment which will lie idle a considerable time
in the course of a working month.

For compiling an average sized union catalogue it is recommended that
two phptographing machines should operate simultaneously at separate points.
The additional speed of coverage will reduce the unit rental costs per machine
and will result in an overall rental saving since the whole process will be
more rapidly completed. In addition travel and per diem costs for the crew
should be somewhat reduced. Speed in photographing is essential for the continuous occupation of the typing units which embrace the majority of project
employment. For greater economy, the photographing machines each should operate  130-150 hours per month.
