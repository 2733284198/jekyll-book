## Appendix A INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTING CARDS TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED FOR UNION
CATALOG

Only the *main* card for each title should be photographed for inclusion
in the union catalog. The following general principles should be observed
in the selection of cards to be photographed:

* All regular author cards for books, pamphlets, etc.
* All title cards for anonymous works
* All temporary author cards
* All main cards for serials
* All regular corporate entry main cards for governmental, state
institutional, etc., publications
* All cross-reference cards relating to authors, individual or corporate
* Main cards for maps, musical works, pictorial works and the like
* Added entries for titles, compilers, editors, translators etc.,
in cases when, given an accurate reference to the work, there
would be doubt as to the correct main entry. Use sparingly.

The following general principles should be observed in determining what
entries are not to be photographed:

* All subject cards
* Title cards where title is an added entry, unless there appears to
be a good reason for making an exception
* All added joint-author entries
* All cross-references relating to subjects
* Added entries for editors, translators, compilers and the like, unless
there appears to be good reason for making an exception.
* Author analytics for chapters, single works, etc., otherwise covered

Disregard any lack of standardization in the entries to be photographed.
Typescript and manuscript cards, in good and bad form, and LC cards are to be
photographed, indiscriminately, in accordance with the principles of selection
for photographing.

In the case of the entry requiring two or more cards to carry complete
bibliographic information, photo-copy all cards. Not to be photographed are the
analytical cards attached to the main entry, when separate author entries of
these analytics are found elsewhere in the library's catalog.

In the event that two or more cards represent the same title, but with
the slightest variation in bibliographic information or collation, all cards

should be photographed.

As the "factor of safety", follow this rule: When in doubt, photograph.
