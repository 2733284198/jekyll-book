## Appendix N: BASIC PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECT OPERATION

The space supplied for the project work must be sufficiently large to
house the personnel. Overcrowding is not conducive to efficient and satisfactory operation. Adherence to standard office practice is recommended. The
filing and typing units should be in the same room, if possible. With a relatively small project this is possible. The filers first of all should be located in the room where the catalogue will be permanently located, as it is a
dangerous undertaking to move twelve hundred (1200) or more completely filled
trays any great distance.

The tables for typists and filers can be constructed by carpenters employed by the project. The specifications for typing tables are standard
typing heighth, five feet wide and twelve feet long and legs so placed as to
allow six typists on each side. The length will vary with the room space alloted the typing unit. Filing tables are the same, but of standard height.

Specifications for catalogue cases may be taken from a standard unit
found in libraries. Cases and trays can be constructed in a reasonably adequate fashion by project carpenters.

The Nebraska Union Catalogue Project constructed four cases and 1,000
trays, complete with rods, backing blocks, handles, etc., for a materials
cost of $275.00.
